         <div class="abstract"><i>Abstract:</i>
            Why do the tannaim exempt women from time-bound commandments (m. Qiddushin 1:7)? In
            this paper it is argued that the unequal levels of obligation for men and women in
            rabbinic Judaism creates a hierarchy of mitzvot between them that mimics and virtually
            replaces the earlier biblical hierarchy of mitzvot between priests and Israel. In
            both constellations the rabbis consider the obligation to fulfill more commandments
            to be a privilege. The similarity between the hierarchies priests–Israel and men–women
            becomes apparent when the selection of commandments from which the tannaim and the
            amoraim explicitly exempt women are examined more closely: Many of them – the time-bound
            commandments shofar, lulav, tzitzit, tefillin, and shema as well as the non-time-bound
            mitzvah of Torah study – share a common feature, namely, their function as “ersatz
            Temple rituals.” During the transition from a Temple-oriented, priest-based Judaism
            to a study-oriented rabbinic Judaism, rituals such as these played a crucial role.

            <p>Judaism is a <i>religion of time</i> aiming at the <i>sanctification of time.</i><sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn1" id="rfn1">1</a></sup></p>
            </div>
         
         <p>What is the difference between a Jewish man and a Jewish woman? From the perspective
            of observance and ritual practice, the answer is: In rabbinic Judaism, men are obligated,
            as a rule, to fulfill all the commandments, while women are not. This distinction
            between the sexes is based on a rabbinic principle handed down in the Mishnah in tractate
            Qiddushin:</p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>All positive time-related obligations [כל מצות עשה שהזמן גרמה]—the men are obligated
               and the women are exempt, and all positive commandments not time-related both men
               and women are obligated. And all negative commandments, whether time-related or not
               time-related, are obligatory for both men and women, except for “you shall not mar,”
               “you shall not round” and “there shall none defile himself for the dead.”<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn2" id="rfn2">2</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>What is the purpose of the tannaitic classification of the mitzvot into four categories—time-bound
            and non-time-bound prescriptions and time-bound and non-time-bound proscriptions<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn3" id="rfn3">3</a></sup>—and why do the <i>tannaim</i> obligate men to all four categories and women to only three of them? No justification
            for this principle is offered in tannaitic literature, and the same is true of amoraic
            literature. Furthermore, the rabbis themselves question it, and its implementation
            is inconsistent.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn4" id="rfn4">4</a></sup> Beginning with reflections on the addressees of biblical laws, the significance of
            the exemption of women from time-bound commandments in rabbinic literature and the
            inconsistent implementation of this exemption will be analyzed below. I argue that
            the purpose of the principle handed down in m. Qiddushin 1:7 is to establish in rabbinic
            Judaism a hierarchy of mitzvot between men and women that corresponds to the biblical
            hierarchy of mitzvot between priests and Israel.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn5" id="rfn5">5</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>What does “hierarchy of mitzvot” mean? In general, the Torah text obligates “Israel”
            or “the people” (ישראל, בני ישראל, כל-עדת ישראל, כל-עדת בני-ישראל, עם) to observe
            its laws and does not, as a rule, distinguish between men and women.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn6" id="rfn6">6</a></sup> However, the text does differentiate between commandments that are binding on the
            people and commandments that apply only to (male) priests:<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn7" id="rfn7">7</a></sup> Unlike the people, priests are obligated to fulfill (and authorized to perform) a
            myriad of rituals associated with the Tabernacle and, later, with the Temple.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn8" id="rfn8">8</a></sup> In contrast to biblical law, the <i>tannaim</i> and the <i>amoraim</i> differentiate between men and women and obligate men to observe more commandments
            than women. Moreover, both the Mishnah and the Gemara hand down a principle according
            to which the obligation to more commandments is considered a privilege associated
            with a higher social status. In the Gemara of tractate Qiddushin, for example, Rabbi
            Hanina is quoted as follows:<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn9" id="rfn9">9</a></sup></p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>Greater [is one who] is commanded [to do a mitzvah] and performs [it] than one who
               is not commanded [to do a mitzvah] and performs [it].<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn10" id="rfn10">10</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>In the Torah, there is a hierarchy of mitzvot—a hierarchy based on unequal degrees
            of obligation—between the priests and the people; in rabbinic literature, the hierarchy
            of mitzvot is between men and women. In the Torah, men who are not priests and women
            are obligated to largely the same range of commandments.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn11" id="rfn11">11</a></sup> The <i>tannaim</i>, however, build on the gender hierarchy pervasive in antiquity by exempting women
            from time-bound commandments.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn12" id="rfn12">12</a></sup> While the biblical hierarchy of mitzvot between the priests and the people persists
            in rabbinic Judaism, it could no longer be practiced without the Temple and thus assumed
            a symbolic character.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn13" id="rfn13">13</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>Researchers have shown that, during the transition from priestly Temple Judaism to
            text-oriented rabbinic Judaism, various aspects of priestly duties were extended to
            the people.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn14" id="rfn14">14</a></sup> An analysis of these changes in the context of the addressees of biblical law, however,
            shows that some of the tasks previously within the sole competence of the priests
            were assigned by the tannaitic and amoraic rabbis not to the entire people (<i>am</i> or <i>yisrael</i>) but to men alone.</p>
         
         <p>The hierarchy of mitzvot between men and women, established by the <i>tannaim</i> in m. Qiddushin 1:7, mimics the hierarchy of mitzvot between priests and Israel and
            virtually replaces it. The similarity between the two hierarchies becomes apparent
            when the selection of commandments from which the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> explicitly exempt women are examined more closely: Many of the mitzvot from which
            they exempt women—non-time-bound as well as time-bound commandments—share a common
            feature, namely, their function as Temple ritual substitutes or “ersatz Temple rituals.”
            Among them, on the one hand, are the non-time-bound commandment <i>talmud torah</i> and time-bound rituals associated with it such as the <i>shema,</i> which contains the commandments <i>tefillin</i> and <i>tzitzit.</i><sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn15" id="rfn15">15</a></sup> Also included, on the other hand, are Temple rituals such as <i>lulav</i> and <i>shofar,</i> which are transformed for a religious practice in the absence of the Temple.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn16" id="rfn16">16</a></sup> Furthermore, the obligation to <i>talmud torah</i>, which is central to rabbinic Judaism, is a continuation of the priestly task of
            teaching.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn17" id="rfn17">17</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>In the synagogal Torah-reading ritual presented in the Tosefta and the Babylonian
            Talmud of tractate Megillah, there is something similar: While the occasional public
            Torah readings mentioned in biblical texts are carried out by priests or other male
            dignitaries, the task of Torah reading in rabbinic Judaism is extended to the entirety
            of men.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn18" id="rfn18">18</a></sup> In neither of these cases, however (exemption of women from time-bound commandments
            and extension of the task of reading Torah in public to all male members of the community),
            do the rabbis prohibit women from performing these rituals.</p>
         
         <p>This paper is composed of two parts. Part 1 focuses on the biblical addressees of
            21 commandments discussed in the Talmudic tractates Qiddushin and Berakhot. In the
            relevant passages, women’s exemption from and their obligation to a total of 11 time-bound
            and 10 non-time-bound commandments is debated. The issue here is whether the Torah
            provides textual evidence for the difference between men’s and women’s obligation
            vis-à-vis these mitzvot: Is there a correlation between the addressees of the Torah
            verses on which the 21 commandments are based<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn19" id="rfn19">19</a></sup> and the rabbinic assignment of these laws to men and women? Part 2 is devoted to
            the rabbinic category of time-bound commandments (מצוות עשה שהזמן גרמן).<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn20" id="rfn20">20</a></sup> This category will be analyzed on the basis of the 21 commandments examined in Part
            1. What made the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> explicitly exempt women from some commandments? Why is the category of time-bound
            commandments significant? And can consistent criteria be identified for the exemption
            of women from commandments?</p>
         
         <h2>1&nbsp;To Whom Are the Biblical Commandments Recognized by the Tannaim and Amoraim Addressed
            and How Do the Rabbis Interpret Them?</h2>
         
         
         
         <h3>1.1&nbsp;21 Selected Commandments</h3>
         
         	
         
         <p>The Torah generally addresses “Israel” or “the people.”<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn21" id="rfn21">21</a></sup> Is this also true of those instructions in the bible that the tannaitic and amoraic
            literature later identified as biblical commandments? In order to find an answer to
            this question, a total of 21 such instructions taken from all five books of the Torah
            will be analyzed. The selection of instructions builds upon a Talmudic discussion
            of women’s obligation to and exemption from mitzvot. The Gemara on m. Qiddushin 1:7
            and on m. Berakhot 3:3 hand down debates on the nature of time-bound and non-time-bound
            commandments. In the Gemara in b. Qiddushin 33b–35a, this debate is addressed in the
            course of a discussion on the obligation or exemption, as the case may be, of women
            to and from 17 mitzvot. A similar debate in b. Berakhot 20b addresses 4 additional
            mitzvot (as well as 3 that appear in the aforementioned discussion in tractate Qiddushin).
            The total of 21 commandments are so called מצוות מדאורייתא: Commandments that, according
            to the rabbis, are among the Torah’s 613 laws.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn22" id="rfn22">22</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>In their discussions of biblical pre- and proscriptions, tannaitic and amoraic rabbis
            typically refer to one or more Torah verses.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn23" id="rfn23">23</a></sup> Who are the addressees of these verses? And how do the rabbis decide to obligate
            women to or exempt them from observing a particular commandment? Can relevant criteria
            be derived by identifying the biblical addressees of the verse on which the law is
            based? Table 1 shows that more than three-fourths of the 21 commandments (17 of 21)
            are based on Torah verses that address Israel in one of four ways: 11 address <i>yisrael</i>,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn24" id="rfn24">24</a></sup> 4 <i>bnei yisrael,</i> and 1 each <i>kol-adat</i> <i>yisrael</i> and <i>kol-adat</i> <i>bnei</i>-<i>yisrael</i>. Of the remaining 4 commandments, 1 addresses the people (<i>am</i>), 1 Aaron, 1 humankind (אדם; male and female), and 1 the priests and the elders of
            Israel.</p>

         <p>In the two Talmudic passages, women are exempt from 7 time-bound commandments and
            obligated to 7 non-time-bound commandments. These 14 mitzvot follow the rule laid
            down in m. Qiddushin 1:7, according to which women are exempt from time-bound and
            obligated to non-time-bound commandments. The remaining 7 commandments, however, one-third
            of the total, contradict the rule of m. Qiddushin 1:7: Women are obligated to 4 time-bound
            commandments and exempt from 3 non-time-bound commandments. The distribution of the
            addressees of the Torah verses upon which this subset of 7 commandments are based
            differs from that of the 21 mitzvot taken as a whole: Slightly less than half of the
            7 address Israel (2 <i>yisrael</i> and 1 <i>kol-adat yisrael</i>); 1 addresses the people; and 3 address other groups or individuals (humankind [<i>adam;</i> male and female], Aaron, the priests and the elders of Israel). Yet another picture
            emerges when the 4 time-bound commandments to which women are obligated and the 3
            non-time-bound commandments from which they are exempt are viewed separately: In the
            first of these groups, half of the commandments address Israel (1 <i>yisrael</i> and 1 <i>kol-adat</i> <i>yisrael</i>) whereas in the second group, only 1 commandment—one-third of the group—addresses
            <i>yisrael</i>.</p>
         
         <p>In sum, consideration of the 21 commandments with a focus on the addressees of the
            relevant Torah verses reveals neither a uniform pattern nor a clarifying explanation
            for the Talmudic obligation or non-obligation of women. Rather, it becomes clear that
            the rabbis not only frequently obligate women to or exempt them from commandments
            regardless of the criterion of time-boundness but also that they do so independently
            of the addressee of the corresponding Torah verse.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn28" id="rfn28">28</a></sup></p>
         
         
         <h3>1.2&nbsp;One Biblical Addressee: More Than One Rabbinic Assignee</h3>
         
         
         
         <p>“Even women are [included] in the [scriptural] meaning” (אף הנשים במשמע):<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn29" id="rfn29">29</a></sup> The <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> sometimes use this phrase to interpret verses that address <i>bnei</i> <i>yisrael</i>. This statement as well as the obligation of women to numerous commandments addressed
            to <i>yisrael</i> suggest that the rabbis generally view women as members of <i>yisrael</i> in one of its forms (<i>bnei</i> <i>yisrael</i>, <i>yisrael,</i> <i>kol-adat</i> <i>yisrael,</i> and <i>kol-adat</i> <i>bnei</i>-<i>yisrael</i>).<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn30" id="rfn30">30</a></sup> Just because women are seen as members of <i>yisrael</i>, however, does not mean that the tannaitic and amoraic rabbis obligate them to fulfill
            all time-bound commandments. This is because they generally determine obligation independent
            of the addressees of the Torah verses upon which commandments are based. Take, for
            example, a series of time-bound commandments concerning the festival of <i>sukkot,</i> all four of which address <i>bnei yisrael</i>:</p>

            <p>[Leviticus 23:33] The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: [34] Speak to the people of Israel,
               saying: On the fifteenth day of this seventh month, and lasting seven days, there
               shall be the festival of booths to the Lord. [35] The first day shall be a holy convocation;
               you shall not work at your occupations. [36] Seven days you shall present the Lord’s
               offerings by fire; on the eighth day you shall observe a holy convocation and present
               the Lord’s offerings by fire; it is a solemn assembly; you shall not work at your
               occupations. (…) [40] On the first day you shall take the fruit of majestic trees,
               branches of palm trees, boughs of leafy trees, and willows of the brook; and you shall
               rejoice before the Lord your God for seven days. (…) [42] You shall live in booth
               for seven days; all that are citizens in Israel shall live in booth, [43] so that
               your generations may know that I made the people of Israel live in booth when I brought
               them out of the land of Egypt: I am the Lord your God. [44] Thus Moses declared to
               the people of Israel the appointed festivals of the Lord.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn31" id="rfn31">31</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>The commandment to rest on the first day of <i>sukkot</i> is based on Leviticus 23:35; the commandment to rest on the eighth day is based on
            the following verse; <i>lulav</i> is based on 23:40; and, finally, temporary dwelling in the <i>sukkah</i> is based on 23:42. The Talmudic rabbis exempt women from the two commandments associated
            with the performance of a ritual, <i>lulav</i> and <i>sukkah</i>, but obligate them to the commandments to rest, which can be fulfilled without performing
            a ritual.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn32" id="rfn32">32</a></sup> It is true that the commandment to rest can be fulfilled only by respecting the prohibition
            on working during festivals; in other words, the commandment to rest is based on an
            analogy to a series of proscriptions, and proscriptions generally and virtually without
            exception apply equally to men and women.</p>
         
         <p>For an analysis of Torah verses that address <i>yisrael,</i> it makes sense to look at Moses’ second speech in Deuteronomy 4:44–28:69, which contains
            11 of the 21 commandments at issue here.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn33" id="rfn33">33</a></sup> Women are obligated to 7 of the 11, whereby one of them—rejoicing on the festivals—is
            time-bound.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn34" id="rfn34">34</a></sup> And they are exempt from the other 4 commandments, which include the 3 time-bound
            commandments <i>shema</i>, <i>tefillin</i>, and <i>re’iyah</i> as well as the non-time-bound <i>talmud torah</i>. 5 of the 11 commandments appear in the passage comprising the first paragraph of
            the <i>shema</i>: the <i>shema</i> itself<i>, talmud torah</i>, and <i>tefillin,</i> from which women are exempt, as well as the non-time-bound commandments <i>mezuzah</i> and <i>birkat hamazon,</i> to which they are obligated.</p>
         
         <p>As shown by these examples, neither the addressees of the Torah verses on which a
            commandment is based nor the principle of time-boundness as expressed in m. Qiddushin
            1:7 are reliable criteria for the obligation or exemption of women with regard to
            a mitzvah.</p>
         
         
         <h3>1.3&nbsp;Rabbinic Assignment Deviates from Biblical Addressees</h3>
         
         
         
         <p>The <i>hakhel</i> ceremony as commanded in Deuteronomy 31:12 calls for the assembly every seven years
            of “the people <i>[am]</i>—men, women, and children, as well as the aliens residing in your towns (…).” This
            detailed explication of “the people” is unusual.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn35" id="rfn35">35</a></sup> Parallels to this explicit language can be found in rabbinic literature, for example,
            in the context of <i>tzitzit,</i> which addresses <i>bnei</i> <i>yisrael</i>: “Even women are [included] in the [scriptural] meaning.”<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn36" id="rfn36">36</a></sup> <i>Hakhel</i> is the only one of the 21 commandments under discussion whose underlying Torah verse
            expressly addresses both men and women<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn37" id="rfn37">37</a></sup> and that is also seen in the <i>baraita</i> in b. Qiddushin as obligatory for both men and women.</p>
         
         <p>In three instances, however, the rabbinic assignment of obligation deviates from the
            addressee of the underlying Torah verse or from the extended biblical explication
            of addressees. This is the case for the commandments concerning procreation,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn38" id="rfn38">38</a></sup> rejoicing on festivals,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn39" id="rfn39">39</a></sup> and fearing father and mother.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn40" id="rfn40">40</a></sup> With regard to the latter, namely, the non-time-bound commandment to fear parents
            (discussed in detail below), the Gemara obligates both women as well as men, even
            though the underlying Torah verse, which follows a reference to the collective <i>kol-adat</i> <i>bnei</i>-<i>yisrael</i>, itself addresses a (grammatically male) individual (<i>ish</i>).<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn41" id="rfn41">41</a></sup> And this is not all: In b. Qiddushin 34b, the Gemara derives from the obligation
            of women to fear parents the principle according to which they are obligated, as a
            rule, to non-time-bound commandments.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn42" id="rfn42">42</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>The Torah verse underlying this commandment, Leviticus 19:3, speaks first to a singular
            addressee <i>ish</i> before continuing in the second person plural:</p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>[Leviticus 19:1] The Lord spoke to Moses, saying: [2] Speak to all the congregation
               of the people of Israel and say to them: You shall be holy, for I the Lord your God
               am holy. [3] You shall each [איש] revere [תיראו] your mother and father, and you shall
               keep [תשמרו] my sabbaths: I am the Lord your God.</p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>In the biblical context, the meaning of the term <i>ish</i> is not limited solely to “man” but can also have the broader meaning “humankind”
            or “person.”<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn43" id="rfn43">43</a></sup> Using the plural form of the verb to fear (תיראו) in their arguments,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn44" id="rfn44">44</a></sup> the Babylonian Talmud and Midrash Sifra interpret the commandment of fearing parents,
            based on Leviticus 19:3, as obligatory for both men and women.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn45" id="rfn45">45</a></sup> A <i>baraita</i> in b. Qiddushin 30b does, however, raise the question as to the source of the obligation
            of women to fear parents, given that Leviticus 19:3 addresses only the male (<i>ish</i>):</p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>If so, [that both of them are obligated,] what [is the meaning when] the verse states:
               “Man?” [In the case of] a man, [it is] in his power to perform [this mitzvah; whereas
               with regard to] a woman, [it is] not [always] in her power to perform [this mitzvah,]
               because she is under the authority of another [person, i.e., her husband].<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn46" id="rfn46">46</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>In this statement, priority is given to the familial obligations of a married woman
            to her husband. In so doing, the <i>baraita</i> emphasizes her dependence on him. Nevertheless, the rabbis obligate women to the
            commandment of fearing parents. If Leviticus 19:3 is viewed in the context of a speech
            delivered to “all the congregation of the people of Israel” (כל-עדת בני-ישראל; Leviticus
            19:2), women are just as much addressees as men.</p>
         
         <p>The analysis of commandments listed in b. Qiddushin 33b–35a and b. Berakhot 20b whose
            assignment to men and women deviates from their biblical addressees also shows clearly
            that the addressees of Torah verses are unreliable as a criterion for the Talmudic
            exemption or obligation of women with regard to a mitzvah. The same is true of the
            principle handed down in m. Qiddushin 1:7 concerning the exemption and obligation
            of women with regard to time-bound and non-time-bound commandments.</p>
         
         
         
         <h2>2&nbsp;A Principle That Isn’t: Women’s Exemption from Time-Bound Commandments</h2>
         
         
         
         <h3>2.1&nbsp;Tefillin: The Paradigmatic Time-Bound Commandment</h3>
         
         	
         
         <p>The commandment to don <i>tefillin</i> plays a special role with regard to the exemption of women from a number of mitzvot.
            This is because a general principle is established in the Gemara to m. Qiddushin 1:7:<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn47" id="rfn47">47</a></sup></p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>From where do we [derive that] women are exempt from positive, time-bound mitzvot?
               [It is] derived [by juxtaposition] from [the mitzvah of] phylacteries: Just as women
               are exempt from [donning] phylacteries, so too, women are exempt from all positive,
               time-bound mitzvot.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn48" id="rfn48">48</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>In this Gemara, the donning of <i>tefillin</i> is treated as the paradigmatic time-bound commandment from which the entirety of
            time-bound commandments is derived. Immediately following this passage, the Gemara
            explains the exemption of women from <i>tefillin</i> by referring to their exemption from <i>talmud torah</i>, a non-time-bound commandment:</p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>And [the exemption of women from donning] phylacteries is derived from [their exemption
               from] Torah study, [as derived from Deuteronomy 11:19], so too women are exempt from
               [donning] phylacteries, [as the two issues are juxtaposed in the Torah (Deuteronomy
               6:7–8)].<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn49" id="rfn49">49</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>This line of argumentation can provide insight into what might have motivated the
            <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> to exempt women from various time-bound and non-time-bound commandments. It should
            be noted that the Gemara in b. Qiddushin associates <i>tefillin</i> and in y. Berakhot the <i>shema</i> with the non-time-bound commandment <i>talmud torah</i>.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn50" id="rfn50">50</a></sup> This association is decisive, since the tannaitic and amoraic rabbis accord <i>talmud torah</i> exceptional significance: They use the obligation to study to close the gap that
            appeared following the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 C.E., when many of the
            commandments and rituals of Temple activity that contributed to the maintenance of
            Jewish identity lost their relevance.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn51" id="rfn51">51</a></sup> In so doing, the rabbis create a parallel between priests and their Temple rituals,
            on the one hand, and between non-priestly men and their study of Torah, on the other.</p>
         
         <p>This parallel between the status of priests and that of scholars is exemplified by
            a Mishnah in tractate Horayot. In m. Horayot 3:8, the social hierarchy is illustrated
            on the basis of the status of various groups of men. As a rule, priests are at the
            top of this hierarchy; however, if Torah scholarship is considered, the Mishnah accords
            a learned “bastard” (ממזר תלמיד חכמים)<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn52" id="rfn52">52</a></sup> a higher status than an ignorant high priest (כהן גדול עם הארץ).<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn53" id="rfn53">53</a></sup> In other words, acquired learning overcomes the inborn stigma of the <i>mamzer</i> and even trumps the inborn status of the high priest.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn54" id="rfn54">54</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>The obligation to continue <i>mishkan</i>- and Temple-related rituals such as <i>lulav</i> and <i>shofar</i> is also assigned solely to men.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn55" id="rfn55">55</a></sup> Whereas the Torah text distinguishes between the priestly elite and the people, in
            rabbinic Judaism, all free adult males take on the high social status previously reserved
            for (male) priests, a status that is associated with more obligations.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn56" id="rfn56">56</a></sup> The <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> limit themselves, however, to an exemption—a kind of dispensation<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn57" id="rfn57">57</a></sup>—of women from these commandments and, in contrast to the Torah, forego an explicit
            prohibition. Whereas the ordinary person—man or woman—was forbidden to carry out priestly
            functions in the Temple,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn58" id="rfn58">58</a></sup> in rabbinic Judaism, women are not forbidden, but exempt: They are not required to
            take on a number of obligations but are permitted to carry them out voluntarily. However,
            the voluntary observance of commandments to which she is not obligated does not entitle
            a woman to the same high status accorded free adult men. The rabbis emphasize repeatedly
            that the fulfilling of commandments to which a person is obligated deserves more regard
            than the voluntary fulfilling of commandments to which he or she is not obligated.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn59" id="rfn59">59</a></sup></p>
         
         
         <h3>2.2&nbsp;Arguing with Time-Boundness</h3>
         
         
         
         <p>What is a time-bound commandment? The <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> address this question in the tractates Qiddushin and Berakhot: As noted above, they
            mention <i>sukkah,</i> <i>lulav</i>, <i>shofar</i>, <i>tzitzit</i>, <i>tefillin,</i> and <i>shema</i> as examples of time-bound commandments from which women are exempt.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn60" id="rfn60">60</a></sup> These six examples of <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i> do not appear to be illustrative, however, but rather to make up a virtually exhaustive
            list.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn61" id="rfn61">61</a></sup> Indeed, in the Gemara of both Talmuds, there seems to be just one additional commandment
            accompanied by the argument of time-boundness when exempting women, and this commandment
            is included in the discussion of m. Qiddushin1:7 as well:<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn62" id="rfn62">62</a></sup> In the context of the obligation to appear in the Temple on each of the three pilgrim
            festivals (Deuteronomy 16:16; ראייה), the question of why women—despite the time-boundness
            of the commandment (which by itself would suffice as a ground for exemption)—are expressly
            exempted on account of the Torah phrase “all your males” (כל-זכורך) is posed in b.
            Qiddushin 34b.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn63" id="rfn63">63</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>The time-boundness of a number of these six mitzvot is the subject of controversy:
            Tannaitic and amoraic literature hand down contradictory opinions with regard to <i>tzitzit</i>, <i>shema,</i> and <i>tefillin</i> (the paradigmatic time-bound commandment).<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn64" id="rfn64">64</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>After first referring to <i>tzitzit</i> as an example of a non-time-bound commandment—to which women are, as a rule, obligated—the
            Tosefta and the Jerusalem Talmud then hand down Rabbi Shimon’s opposing opinion, which
            ultimately prevailed:</p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>What is a positive commandment that is not activated by time? For example returning
               lost articles, sending away the [mother from the] nest, railing, and donning <i>tzitzit</i>. Rabbi Shimon exempts women from <i>tzitzit</i> because it is a positive commandment activated by time.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn65" id="rfn65">65</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>In the eyes of some rabbis, <i>tefillin</i>, too, does not belong to the category of time-bound commandments. In tractate Eruvin
            of the Babylonian Talmud, for example, it is inferred from the statements of Rabbi
            Meir and Rabbi Yehuda that <i>tefillin</i> is not time-bound:</p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>Michal, daughter of Kushi, would don phylacteries, and the Sages did not protest against
               her [behavior]. (…) From [the fact] that the Sages did not protest against [Michal’s
               donning phylacteries], it is apparent that these [Sages] hold [that phylacteries]
               is a positive mitzvah not bound by time. (…) Rather, it is this tanna [who taught
               the halakha], as it was taught [in the Tosefta]: One who finds phylacteries [on Shabbat]
               brings them in pair [by] pair, whether a man or whether a woman, whether [the phylacteries
               are] new or whether [they are] old. [This is] the statement of Rabbi Meir. Rabbi Yehuda
               prohibits [bringing in] new [phylacteries], but [he] permits [bringing in] old [ones].
               [They] disagree only with regard to [the issue of] new [phylacteries] and old one;
               however, with regard to a woman [bringing the phylacteries], they do not disagree
               [that it is permitted]. Learn from it [that this tanna maintains that donning phylacteries]
               is a positive mitzvah not bound by time, and women are obligated in every positive
               mitzvah not bound by time.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn66" id="rfn66">66</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>This position did not find its way into practice. It is noteworthy, however, that
            in this Gemara, both the time-boundness of <i>tefillin</i> as well as the non-obligation of women to this commandment are called into question.
            And this despite the fact that—as mentioned above—in tractate Qiddushin of the Babylonian
            Talmud <i>tefillin</i> is defined as the paradigmatic time-bound commandment.</p>
         
         <p>To be sure, it is not time-boundness but <i>talmud torah</i> that is at the center of the argument: In b. Qiddushin 34a, the Gemara explains the
            exemption of women from <i>tefillin</i> by means of the non-time-bound commandment to teach and study Torah.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn67" id="rfn67">67</a></sup> The same argument is used in tractate Berakhot of the Jerusalem Talmud in a discussion
            of the exemption of women (and slaves) from the time-bound <i>shema</i>.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn68" id="rfn68">68</a></sup> In this Gemara, the argument is bolstered by pointing to the addressees of the biblical
            commandments of <i>shema</i> and <i>tefillin</i>:</p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>Women, slaves, and minors are exempt from reading the <i>shema</i> and <i>tefillin</i> (…).<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn69" id="rfn69">69</a></sup></p>
            
            <p>Women from where? “You must teach them to your sons.” To your sons but not to your
               daughters. Slaves from where? “Hear, o Israel, the Eternal, our Power, the Eternal
               is unique.” He who has only one Lord, this excludes the slave who has another lord.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn70" id="rfn70">70</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>In exempting women from <i>shema</i>, the Jerusalem Talmud relies on the word “your sons” (לבניך; Deuteronomy 6:7)—addressees
            of <i>tefillin</i> as repeated in Deuteronomy 11:18—and in so doing uses the same argument that the
            rabbis use to explain the non-obligation of women to <i>talmud torah.</i><sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn71" id="rfn71">71</a></sup> They do this even though the fundamental exemption of women from time-bound commandments
            would seem to be the obvious argument.</p>
         
         <p>In exempting women from <i>sukkah,</i> <i>lulav</i>, and <i>shofar</i>—the other three rituals mentioned in the tractates Qiddushin and Berakhot as examples
            of time-bound commandments—the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> also do not base their arguments solely on the ground that these rituals belong to
            the category of time-bound commandments.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn72" id="rfn72">72</a></sup> The question is raised (e.g., by Elizabeth Shanks Alexander and Pamela Barmash) of
            whether the rabbinic exemption of women from time-bound commandments such as <i>shofar</i>, <i>sukkah,</i> and <i>lulav</i> developed independently of the categories handed down in m. Qiddushin 1:7 so that
            these three commandments were only subsequently added to the category <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i> or whether women were exempted as a result of the mishnaic categories.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn73" id="rfn73">73</a></sup> If <i>sukkah,</i> <i>lulav,</i> and <i>shofar</i>—along with <i>talmud torah</i> and its associated time-bound commandments—are viewed as “ersatz Temple rituals,”
            the latter is more likely: The six commandments listed in the tractates Qiddushin
            and Berakhot as examples of time-bound commandments from which women were exempted
            serve to establish a man-woman hierarchy in place of the previously-existing priest-Israel
            hierarchy, both of which are expressed in terms of the unequal obligation to commandments.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn74" id="rfn74">74</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>In discussing the obligations of women with respect to these six time-bound commandments
            as well as to <i>re’iyah,</i> the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> could have relied entirely on the categorical exemption of women from time-bound
            commandments handed down in m. Qiddushin 1:7. Instead, they either question the time-boundness
            of the commandments or they present other grounds for the non-obligation of women.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn75" id="rfn75">75</a></sup> Furthermore, the rabbis are quick to point out the contradiction to the principle
            handed down in m. Qiddushin 1:7 that arises every time women are not obligated to
            non-time-bound commandments.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn76" id="rfn76">76</a></sup> Thus, it seems that time-boundness is not the only criterion for the obligation or
            exemption of women.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn77" id="rfn77">77</a></sup> The alternative argument for the exemption of women based on <i>talmud torah</i> hints at possible rabbinic motives: the creation of a hierarchy between men and women
            that is modeled on the priest-people hierarchy in <i>mishkan</i> and Temple and that redefines traditions in the course of the democratization of
            religious practice during the transition from Temple to rabbinic Judaism.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn78" id="rfn78">78</a></sup> The Torah distinguishes between Israel—that is, (lay)people—and male priests (and
            Levites) and obligates the latter to more commandments. In contrast, the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> obligate ordinary men to a number of commandments—such as the Temple rituals of <i>shofar</i> and <i>lulav</i>—from which they exempt women, who retain the status “people” and who are thus exempt
            from these commandments. The same kind of hierarchical thinking, carried over from
            the biblical to the rabbinic value system, is the basis for the exemption of women
            from <i>talmud torah</i> and its associated commandments: After the destruction of the Second Temple and the
            corresponding loss of Temple rituals, both the tannaitic and amoraic rabbis envision
            a central role for <i>talmud torah</i><sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn79" id="rfn79">79</a></sup> but obligate only men to this mitzvah and its associated rituals, namely, the <i>shema,</i><sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn80" id="rfn80">80</a></sup> which includes <i>tefillin</i> and <i>tzitzit</i>.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn81" id="rfn81">81</a></sup> In so doing, the rabbis draw on the task of teaching Israel given to the Levites
            and priests in Deuteronomy 33:10,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn82" id="rfn82">82</a></sup> expand it, and assign it to all men, leaving women in the role once reserved for
            the entire people.</p>
         
         <p>In contrast, the rabbis do not associate <i>tzitzit</i>—unlike <i>tefillin</i> and <i>shema</i>—with <i>talmud torah.</i> There is, however, an indirect connection. In Numbers 15:39, the verse following
            the source of the commandment (according to the rabbis), the Torah refers to the purpose
            of <i>tzitzit:</i></p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>You have the fringe so that, when you see it, you will remember <i>all the commandments</i> of the Lord and do them, and not follow the lust of your own heart and your own eyes.
               So you shall remember and do <i>all my commandments</i>, and you shall be holy to your God.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn83" id="rfn83">83</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>The purpose of <i>tzitzit</i> is to remind <i>bnei</i> <i>yisrael</i><sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn84" id="rfn84">84</a></sup> to fulfill “all commandments” (כל-מצוות). Since the <i>tannaim</i> do not obligate women to <i>kol mitzvot</i>,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn85" id="rfn85">85</a></sup> the rabbis might have thought, there is no need for a continuous reminder in the
            form of knotted strings on the four corners of a rectangular piece of clothing. The
            <i>tzitzit</i> are merely a physical reminder to fulfill all the commandments, whereas <i>talmud torah</i> leads the student to their actual fulfillment and is thus considered to be more important
            than the fulfillment itself.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn86" id="rfn86">86</a></sup> <i>Tzitzit</i> as a constant companion and reminder and <i>talmud torah</i> as a motivating technique: Both are needed only by those obligated to <i>kol mitzvot</i>.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn87" id="rfn87">87</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>In summary, the rabbinic exemption of women from a number of commandments is the subject
            of debate and requires explication. The <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> do not rely solely on time-boundness; indeed, provisions that deviate from the principle
            of m. Qiddushin 1:7 also shape religious practice. “One does not learn from general
            statements, even in a place where it says: Except”:<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn88" id="rfn88">88</a></sup> This terse comment of Rabbi Yohanan in the Gemara to m. Qiddushin 1:7 puts this into
            words, and it weakens the principle established in this Mishnah. Rabbi Yohanan says
            explicitly what is frequently transmitted only implicitly in tannaitic and amoraic
            literature: The principle that women are exempt from time-bound commandments fails
            to convince the rabbis.</p>
         
         
         <h3>2.3&nbsp;Time in the Context of Autonomy and Holiness</h3>
         
         	
         
         <p>Why do the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> refer to the principle of <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i> when they exempt women from some commandments they recognize as biblical? This question
            is all the more pressing, given their inconsistent application of the principle. Moshe
            Benovitz even considers the term a “misnomer”:<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn89" id="rfn89">89</a></sup> The commandments defined as <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i> in the tractates Qiddushin and Berakhot—<i>sukkah,</i> <i>lulav</i>, <i>shofar</i>, <i>tzitzit</i>, <i>tefillin</i> and <i>shema</i><sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn90" id="rfn90">90</a></sup><i>—</i>can be distinguished from other time-bound commandments from which women are not exempt.
            The unique characteristic of these positive commandments, according to Benovitz, is
            that they are “triggered” <i>solely</i> by a specific point in time and do not, for example, represent a counterpart to a
            prohibition.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn91" id="rfn91">91</a></sup> It is this quality that enables them to encourage Torah study (to which only men
            are obligated):<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn92" id="rfn92">92</a></sup></p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p><i>Tefillin, ṣiṣit, shemac, shofar, sukkah</i> and <i>lulav</i> (and perhaps the paschal offering) are thus uniquely triggered by time and time alone.
               It is this triggering by time alone, rather than by functional considerations, that
               allows these <i>miṣvot</i> to serve as opportunities for Torah study: time triggers the <i>miṣvah</i>, and the sudden <i>miṣvah</i> triggers conversation, or Torah study. One might very well say that the Torah study
               in these cases is triggered by the fact that the <i>miṣvah</i> has an “onset” that is independent of other <i>miṣvot</i> or considerations; it is this feature that makes the <i>miṣvah</i> into pure symbol, a conversation piece. This sudden onset is the true meaning of
               <i>shehazeman geramah</i>.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn93" id="rfn93">93</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>The time factor with regard to several of these commandments, primarily <i>tzitzit,</i> is not, however, uncontroversial among the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i>. Moreover, the question arises as to why a non-time-bound, symbolic commandment such
            as <i>mezuzah</i> (which has no proscriptive counterpart, either) should not also be considered a <i>talmud torah</i> trigger and, consequently, obligatory only for men. It is also questionable if commandments
            such as <i>sukkah</i> and <i>lulav</i> really stimulate <i>talmud torah</i> to a greater extent than do other commandments such as prayer, fasting, or charity.</p>
         
         <p>The tendency in the scholarly literature is to view the principle transmitted in m.
            Qiddushin 1:7 as an ex post justification for the exemption of women from a series
            of commandments that happen to be time-bound.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn94" id="rfn94">94</a></sup> But regardless of when the principle was introduced, in one way or another, the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> must have associated the commandments from which they exempted women with time (זמן).<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn95" id="rfn95">95</a></sup> Given the context of m. Qiddushin 1:7—it is preceded by regulations concerning the
            acquisition (קנה) by men of women, slaves, animals, and goods<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn96" id="rfn96">96</a></sup>—the exemption from a number of time-bound commandments can be seen as an expression
            of women’s lack of autonomy, in contrast to male autonomy, and the fact that they
            were unable to dispose freely of their time:<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn97" id="rfn97">97</a></sup> The rabbis associate the privilege of being obligated to more commandments with time,
            which to them symbolizes independence and freedom.</p>
         
         <p>The principle of <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i> must also be viewed from the perspective of the sanctification of time. In Genesis,
            at the end of the creation story, the Torah refers—in connection with the sanctification
            of the seventh day—to holiness (קדשה).<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn98" id="rfn98">98</a></sup> Günter Stemberger points out that human beings are fundamentally involved in the
            structuring of time and thus also in its sanctification.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn99" id="rfn99">99</a></sup> Whereas the mitzvah of sanctifying Shabbat applies to all, men and women, the mitzvot
            associated with the Temple and its holiness<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn100" id="rfn100">100</a></sup> are reserved, as a rule, for the priests. By transferring the obligation to fulfill
            “ersatz Temple rituals” to men, the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> may also—symbolically—have transferred the sanctification of time, which is associated
            with priestly tasks, to men. This would help minimize the decrease in opportunities
            to engage with holiness<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn101" id="rfn101">101</a></sup> that accompanied the destruction of the Temple and would at the same time make rituals
            that were previously reserved for priests accessible to non-priestly men.</p>
         
         <p>In this transformation of the priestly Temple space into a space characterized by
            time and dominated by male heads of households, Natan Margalit sees a basis for the
            rabbinic category of time-bound commandments.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn102" id="rfn102">102</a></sup> Supported by Judith Hauptman’s claim that the time factor of the <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i> should be understood qualitatively and not quantitatively,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn103" id="rfn103">103</a></sup> Margalit draws parallels between the tasks of priests in the Temple and the tasks
            of men in rabbinic Judaism:</p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>In the post-Temple, rabbinic era of Judaism, the sacred space of the Temple was replaced
               by the increased emphasis on sacred time. The priestly duties of honoring God shifted
               from the realm of priests in the Temple to the male householders in the field of time.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn104" id="rfn104">104</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>Viewed in this light, the legacy of (male) priestly duties and priestly status would
            seem to be the main purpose behind the creation of the rabbinic category of time-bound
            commandments (and the simultaneous exemption of women from them) whereas the attribute
            of time would seem to be only of secondary significance.</p>
         
         <p>Taking into account Stemberger’s “structured time,” which shapes the Jewish year,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn105" id="rfn105">105</a></sup> the exemption of women from time-bound commandments can also be seen as a flip side
            of the male privilege of having a larger share of this structured time and its sanctification.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn106" id="rfn106">106</a></sup> But despite reflections such as these, it must be acknowledged that the correlation
            between the principle of time-bound mitzvot and the notion of time is still widely
            unexplored.</p>
         
         
         <h3>2.4&nbsp;Patur: Exempt, but in Principle Obligated</h3>
         
         	
         
         <p>When exempting women from time-bound commandments in the tractates Qiddushin and Berakhot,
            the rabbis rely on the verb <i>patar</i> (הנשים פטורות).<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn107" id="rfn107">107</a></sup> The term is, however, used for men as well. For example, when exempting a man from
            the <i>shema</i> in Mishnah Berakhot, <i>patar</i> appears twice: in the context of a bridegroom on his wedding night and in the context
            of a mourner prior to burial.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn108" id="rfn108">108</a></sup> Both of these cases involve a temporary exemption from a commandment due to extraordinary
            circumstances.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn109" id="rfn109">109</a></sup> The Mishnah also uses the term <i>patur</i> when permitting men and women to disregard generally applicable prohibitions. In
            life-threatening situations on Shabbat, for example, a light may be extinguished.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn110" id="rfn110">110</a></sup> This, too, involves a temporary suspension of an otherwise binding law.</p>
         
         <p>In contrast, the <i>tannaim</i> do not provide criteria that limit the duration of the exemption of women in m. Qiddushin
            1:7. Thus, the question arises whether <i>patur</i> implies a fundamental obligation regarding time-bound commandments, as in the above
            examples, combined with a permanent exemption—a kind of “dispensation”—or rather a
            fundamental non-obligation. The use of the term <i>patur</i> speaks for the former: Unlike the Torah, which explicitly forbids non-priests from
            carrying out priestly commandments,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn111" id="rfn111">111</a></sup> the tannaitic and amoraic rabbis do not declare a prohibition (אסור).<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn112" id="rfn112">112</a></sup> On the contrary, <i>patur</i> seems to set aside a fundamental obligation of women regarding commandments<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn113" id="rfn113">113</a></sup> on the basis of unnamed circumstances.</p>
         
         <p>Clues as to what might have induced the rabbis to exempt women from time-bound commandments
            can be found, among other places, in a Mishnah in tractate Horayot, which states that
            in a life-threatening situation the life of a man has priority over the life of a
            woman.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn114" id="rfn114">114</a></sup> This statement is an expression of the subordinate status of women in a patriarchal
            society and of her subordinate status in a system in which obligation to commandments
            is considered a privilege and a higher level of obligation leads to a higher social
            status.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn115" id="rfn115">115</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>The context of m. Qiddushin 1:7 also contains clues for correlations between the exemption
            of women from time-bound commandments and their status and for parallels between the
            hierarchies priest–Israel and man–woman: The division of pre- and proscriptions into
            four categories is found in the same chapter as the acquisition <i>(kanah)</i> by free men of women (betrothal), slaves, cattle, and goods<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn116" id="rfn116">116</a></sup> and a listing of eight Temple rituals, of which six are reserved for male priests
            and all without exception are reserved for men.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn117" id="rfn117">117</a></sup> This chapter contains two levels of laws: rabbinic rituals and commandments adapted
            for a Judaism without a Temple and biblical Temple rituals. Whereas the latter in
            m. Qiddushin 1:8—representing the biblical hierarchy priest–Israel—are reserved for
            priests and forbidden to ordinary men and all women (except for laying hands and waving
            when bringing animal sacrifices), the former in m. Qiddushin 1:7—representing the
            hierarchy men–women—do not contain a prohibition for women, but merely an exemption.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn118" id="rfn118">118</a></sup> The absence of a rabbinic prohibition means that women are free to engage in the
            voluntary fulfillment of time-bound commandments.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn119" id="rfn119">119</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>But why do the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> permanently exempt all women from <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i>? If time as a quantifiable resource were the criterion, they could have limited the
            exemption, as they did in the aforementioned examples involving men and the <i>shema</i>.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn120" id="rfn120">120</a></sup> For as a rule a single, divorced, widowed, or childless woman, like a man, has more
            time at her disposal than a wife and mother of young children. Thus, the rabbis need
            only have exempted women temporarily from the performance of commandments where necessary
            due to family or other circumstance. The permanent exemption indicates that rabbinic
            decisions were influenced by a qualitative concept of time, such as the sanctification
            of time.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn121" id="rfn121">121</a></sup> Evidence for this can be seen in the time-bound commandments discussed in the tractates
            Qiddushin and Berakhot: They include the laws associated with the non-time-bound “ersatz
            Temple ritual” <i>talmud torah</i>, namely, <i>shema</i>, <i>tefillin</i>, and <i>tzitzit</i>, and Temple rituals such as <i>shofar</i> and <i>lulav</i> as adapted for rabbinic Judaism. In addition, by exempting women from “ersatz Temple
            rituals,” the tannaitic and amoraic rabbis echo the explicit prohibition of women
            from carrying out Temple rituals as listed, inter alia, in m. Qiddushin 1:8. It is
            noteworthy that this prohibition is limited to Temple rituals. Commandments defined
            as <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i> are closely linked to the Temple and its holiness and to priestly rituals. In contrast,
            time-bound commandments recognized as biblical by the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> that are not closely connected to Temple rituals are generally obligatory for women
            just as they are for men.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn122" id="rfn122">122</a></sup></p>
         
         
         <h3>2.5&nbsp;From Man to Man: “Ersatz Temple Rituals” and the Priestly Legacy</h3>
         
         	
         
         <p>Following their depiction of the four categories of laws in m. Qiddushin 1:7—time-bound
            and non-time-bound prescriptions and time-bound and non-time-bound proscriptions—neither
            the <i>tannaim</i> nor the <i>amoraim</i> provide a justification for this newly created principle.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn123" id="rfn123">123</a></sup> They also do not rely on biblical sources to explain or legitimize this step. The
            Torah text does not distinguish between time-bound and non-time-bound commandments,
            and for the most part, it also does not divide commandments into mitzvot for men and
            mitzvot for women.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn124" id="rfn124">124</a></sup> What motivated the <i>tannaim</i> to divide the commandments into four categories and to apply this system for the
            purpose of distinguishing between men and women (and between men, on the one hand,
            and minors and slaves, on the other)?<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn125" id="rfn125">125</a></sup> The answer might lie in the selection of the time-bound mitzvot used as examples
            in the discussion of the four categories in the tractates Qiddushin and Berakhot:
            They are either mitzvot that the rabbis associated with <i>talmud torah</i>—a practice that took on a central role in rabbinic Judaism as the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> sought to replace the lost Temple rituals—or mitzvot that were associated with priestly
            Temple rituals and that were redefined for rabbinic Judaism.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn126" id="rfn126">126</a></sup> Both groups of commandments can be subsumed under the common category “ersatz Temple
            rituals”: rituals carried out by non-priestly men in place of priestly rites that
            could no longer be performed in the absence of a Temple.</p>
         
         <p>The creation of four categories of laws by the Tannaites and their decision to obligate
            men to all four of them and women to just three leads to a hierarchy of mitzvot between
            men and women that replaces the previously-existing biblical hierarchy of mitzvot
            between priests and Israel. Central to the different obligations of men and women
            to the <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i> is neither the expenditure of time nor the timeframe within which a commandment must
            be fulfilled but rather a differentiation between the religious practice of men and
            women that replaces the differentiation between the religious practice of priests
            and Israel.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn127" id="rfn127">127</a></sup> In other words, this category enables the rabbis to distinguish between the religious
            practice and status of men and women and to bestow the position of highest authority,
            previously reserved for male priests, upon all men (the group of people most like
            themselves):</p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>Women were exempted from the essential ritual acts of Judaism, those that year in
               and year out mark Jewish time, in order to restrict their performance to men, to heads
               of household; only people of highest social standing, according to the rabbis, does
               God consider most fit to honor or worship Him in this important way. This hierarchical
               arrangement is reminiscent of Temple protocol. Only <i>kohanim</i>, the individuals of highest social standing, as evidenced by their more stringent
               rules for marriage, ritual purity, and physical fitness (Leviticus 21), could serve
               as Temple functionaries. The point is that those who serve God must themselves be
               especially worthy. In rabbinic society this meant that only males were fitting candidates
               for the time-bound positive commandments, the highest form of ritual act.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn128" id="rfn128">128</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p><i>Talmud torah</i>, given a crucial role by the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i>, is an identity-generating ritual that, like prayer, helps fill the gaps caused by
            the destruction of the Second Temple.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn129" id="rfn129">129</a></sup> It is no longer the Temple but rather study for the sake of study (תורה לשמה) and
            communal prayer<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn130" id="rfn130">130</a></sup> that are at the center of religious practice. All who are obligated to Torah study
            and its associated mitzvot such as <i>shema</i> and <i>tefillin</i>—that is to say, all free adult men—step into the footsteps of the priests who, in
            the time of the Temple, were exclusively responsible for numerous tasks and mitzvot:<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn131" id="rfn131">131</a></sup></p>
         
         <blockquote>
            
            <p>While the sacrificial service could take place only in the Temple and only be performed
               by people born into a priestly caste with the proper preparation, Torah study could
               now be achieved by anyone (albeit, men only) at any time and place, with the appropriate
               learning ability.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn132" id="rfn132">132</a></sup></p>
            </blockquote>
         
         <p>The situation is similar as far as Temple rituals such as <i>shofar</i> and <i>lulav</i> are concerned. These rituals were reconfigured for life without the Temple and carried
            over into rabbinic Judaism:<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn133" id="rfn133">133</a></sup> all who are obligated to perform them—all ordinary men—take on a role that exhibits
            parallels to that of the priests in the Temple.</p>
         
         <p>During the Temple era, neither the <i>lulav</i> nor the <i>shofar</i> commandment was fulfilled exclusively by priests. Nevertheless, in handing down the
            two rituals, the rabbis describe a practice designed for the Temple in Jerusalem and
            activities reserved for the priests.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn134" id="rfn134">134</a></sup> For example, it is the priests in the Temple who “enter between the entrance hall
            and the altar in order to fulfill [the obligation of the mitzvah of] the willow branch”<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn135" id="rfn135">135</a></sup> and who on the first six days of <i>sukkot</i> circle the altar with the <i>lulav</i> in their hands once and on the last day seven times.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn136" id="rfn136">136</a></sup> During the Temple period, it is only at the Temple itself that the <i>lulav</i> is in use for all seven days of the festival week; outside the Temple, the ritual
            is typically carried out just on the first day of <i>sukkot</i>.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn137" id="rfn137">137</a></sup> And in m. Sukkah 4:4, the Mishnah requires the <i>lulavim</i> to be brought to the Temple mount prior to the beginning of the holiday if the first
            day of <i>sukkot</i> falls on a Shabbat.</p>
         
         <p><i>Shofar</i> is dealt with in a comparable way. For example, a list of various groups of men who
            are obligated to the <i>shofar</i> commandment on <i>rosh hashanah</i> includes priests; according to the Gemara in b. Rosh Hashanah 29a, this explicit
            mention is necessary in order to distinguish between the holiday role of priests,
            who are obligated to <i>shofar</i> throughout the entire year, from the role of the other groups, who are only obligated
            during the New Year’s festival.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn138" id="rfn138">138</a></sup> And in m. Rosh Hashanah 4:1, the Mishnah points out that during the Temple period
            the rules that applied to the blowing of the <i>shofar</i> in Jerusalem when the New Year’s festival fell on Shabbat differed from the rules
            applicable in other places. In Sifre Bamidbar on Numbers 10:8 (“The sons of Aaron,
            the priests, shall blow the trumpets”), the interpretation of the biblical text is
            that the blowing of the <i>shofar</i> on the occasion of a congregational assembly is reserved solely for the priests.
            In light of this and other sources, Shmuel Safrai points out that the Tannaites considered
            the blowing of the <i>shofar</i> in the Temple on <i>rosh hashanah</i> a priestly prerogative.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn139" id="rfn139">139</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>With regard to <i>sukkah</i>, things are somewhat different: Priests have no special role vis-à-vis this commandment.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn140" id="rfn140">140</a></sup> A parallel can be drawn, however, between the Temple space of priests and the <i>sukkah</i> space of ordinary men: Just as the Temple is the space where priests must fulfill
            their religious tasks, the <i>sukkah</i> is the space where ordinary men must fulfill their obligation to dwell in the booth
            during the festival of <i>sukkot</i>.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn141" id="rfn141">141</a></sup> But the same is true here as with all <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman:</i> Whereas the Torah forbids ordinary people from carrying out priestly tasks, rabbinic
            Judaism merely exempts women from these commandments. Thus, while priests must fulfill
            their obligations solely among their peers, married couples may dwell together in
            the booth during the week of <i>sukkot</i> if they so choose.</p>
         
         <p>As mentioned, the Torah text does not, as a rule, distinguish between men and women
            when it commands but rather distinguishes between priests—and other male dignitaries
            such as elders or kings—and Israel. By creating four categories of laws and exempting
            women from one of them, the <i>tannaim</i> mimic the priest-Israel hierarchy and transform it into a man-woman hierarchy.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn142" id="rfn142">142</a></sup> This undertaking is similar to the approach taken in the context of public Torah
            reading:<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn143" id="rfn143">143</a></sup> There, the biblical hierarchy “reading male elite–listening people (men and women)”—as,
            for instance, on the occasion of <i>hakhel</i><sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn144" id="rfn144">144</a></sup>—is transformed into a rabbinic hierarchy “reading and listening man–listening woman.”
            Thus, the task of reading, previously reserved for male dignitaries, is expanded to
            encompass ordinary men, who step into the footsteps of the elite.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn145" id="rfn145">145</a></sup> And just as the <i>tannaim</i> here demonstrate their awareness of the dissonance between Torah and rabbinic commandments
            by permitting—in principle, but not in practice—women to participate in the Torah
            reading ceremony,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn146" id="rfn146">146</a></sup> the Tannaites and Amorites refer in the tractates Qiddushin and Berakhot to an exemption
            of women and not to a prohibition vis-à-vis a number of time-bound commandments. In
            practice, however, it is usually just men—explicitly obligated by the rabbis—who fulfill
            the <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i>, even though the Torah addresses these commandments to the entire people of Israel,
            regardless of sex. This assignment of commandments, which often deviates from the
            biblical addressees, reflects the patriarchal social order of antiquity as well as
            a tradition that might have been customary already at the time of the Torah.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn147" id="rfn147">147</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>By applying different rules to men and women in post-Temple Judaism, the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> created a principle parallel to the different commandments that applied to the priests
            and Israel as handed down in the Torah. Their motive for this step might be revealed
            by an examination of the selection of mitzvot to which they obligated men and exempted
            women: The common feature of these commandments was their character as “ersatz Temple
            rituals.” By using these rituals to distinguish between the sexes, the rabbis perpetuated
            the elite role and status of priests, with men walking in their footsteps. The resulting
            inequality in the degrees of obligation of men and women has shaped the religious
            practice of Jewish women (and men) for centuries.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn148" id="rfn148">148</a></sup> In this context, however, the unequal size of the juxtaposed groups must not be ignored:
            Whereas the priests were a minority,<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn149" id="rfn149">149</a></sup> women make up half of the population. In contrast to the Torah, which conferred the
            privilege of the obligation to a broader spectrum of commandments on a small male
            elite, the rabbis, with their hierarchy of mitzvot conferred privileged status on
            all men, a move that goes hand-in-hand with a lower social status for all women.</p>
         
         
         
         <h2>3&nbsp;Conclusions</h2>
         
         
         
         <p>When the Torah commands, it does not, as a rule, distinguish between men and women;
            instead, most of its mitzvot are addressed to the people as a whole (<i>bnei</i> <i>yisrael</i>, <i>yisrael,</i> etc.). The Torah text does, however, distinguish between commandments that apply
            only to priests and those that apply to the people as a whole. In contrast, the <i>tannaim</i> introduce a systematic framework for distinguishing between commandments for men
            and commandments for women: In m. Qiddushin 1:7, they create four categories of commandments
            whose only purpose appears to be to limit the obligation to some commandments to men
            alone. In defining these categories, the rabbis do not rely on biblical sources. There
            are six commandments from which the rabbis exempt women in the tractates Qiddushin
            and Berakhot on the basis of time-boundness and with which they illustrate the category
            of <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i>—<i>sukkah,</i> <i>lulav</i>, <i>shofar</i>, <i>tzitzit</i>, <i>tefillin,</i> and <i>shema</i>.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn150" id="rfn150">150</a></sup> However, an equal number of commandments contradict this principle: In these tractates,
            women are also exempted from three non-time-bound and obligated to four time-bound
            commandments. Thus, not only the principle of m. Qiddushin 1:7 but also the exception
            to this principle would seem to be the rule.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn151" id="rfn151">151</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>The six time-bound commandments from which the Gemara in Qiddushin and Berakhot exempts
            women are illustrative of the category <i>mitzvot aseh she hazman graman</i>. In the Gemara of the two Talmuds, there appears to be just one additional commandment—<i>re’iyah</i>—from which women are exempted explicitly on the basis of time-boundness. Thus, these
            seven mitzvot make up an exhaustive list.<sup><a class="xref-bibr" href="#fn152" id="rfn152">152</a></sup></p>
         
         <p>The <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> provide no justification for the categorization in m. Qiddushin 1:7, and references
            to Torah verses, which would root their approach in the biblical text and lend it
            legitimacy, are few and far between. Instead, they repeatedly question the principle
            and frequently do not rely solely on time-boundness when exempting women from time-bound
            commandments.</p>
         
         <p>Possible grounds for the principle handed down in m. Qiddushin 1:7 that leads to a
            distinction between commandments for men and commandments for women can be found in
            the selection of laws that the rabbis list as examples of time-bound commandments
            to which women are not obligated: For them, <i>sukkah,</i> <i>lulav</i>, <i>shofar</i>, <i>tzitzit</i>, <i>tefillin,</i> <i>shema</i>, and Torah study symbolize rituals that play a central role in the transformation
            of a Judaism grounded in offering and Temple rituals—many of which were reserved for
            priests alone—into a text and study-oriented rabbinic Judaism. In this context, the
            inconsistent principle regarding the exemption of women from time-bound commandments
            handed down in m. Qiddushin 1:7—which can be summarized under the moniker “ersatz
            Temple rituals”—enables the rabbis to create a hierarchy of mitzvot between men and
            women that takes the place of the previously-existing hierarchy between priests and
            Israel.</p>
         
         <p>What is the difference between a Jewish man and a Jewish woman? From the perspective
            of the hierarchy proposed in this paper, the answer is: After the Temple ceased to
            exist, men stepped into the footsteps of the priests and women remained Israel.</p>

                  – both men and women left Egypt – she suggests an inclusive meaning, e.g., in Leviticus
                  23:42–44 (commandment of <i>sukkah</i>; Erbele-Küster, “Der Dienst,” 277–279; see also Brettler, “Women in the Decalogue,”

                  from a biblical perspective, <i>ben</i> does not exclusively mean “son” can be found in Leviticus 6:11: There, the term is

                  of male protagonists as compared to female protagonists and in the fact that direct
                  discourse between God and humankind takes place almost exclusively with men (for exception
                  see e.g.&nbsp;Van der Horst, “Rebekah,” 143). Unlike the Torah, which forbids lay people
                  from performing priestly tasks (see footnote 57), the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> merely exempt women from time-bound commandments; they do not forbid their performance
                  by women (Hauptman, <i>Rereading the Rabbis</i>, 227; Hauptman, “From the Kitchen,” 121–122). The view that women are prohibited
                  from donning <i>tefillin</i> can be found in post-Talmudic rabbinic literature (Brody, “Women, Tefillin, and the

                  constitute a third group, one that serves both the priests and Israel (see e.g.&nbsp;Numbers
                  3:5–13). Given the range of commandments to which they are obligated (and their resulting
                  status), they are located between these two groups; see Haran, <i>Temples and Temple-Service</i>, 84–87; Shectman, “The Social Status,” 83–84; for a differentiated consideration
                  of the status of the Levites in biblical times see Leuchter, <i>The Levites</i>; see also m. Horayot 3:8. This paper focuses on the status of priests and Israel
                  since the topic at issue – “ersatz Temple rituals” from which women were exempt –
                  is rooted in priestly tasks and not in the (serving) tasks of the Levites. By transferring
                  “ersatz Temple rituals” to men and not to women, the <i>tannaim</i> and <i>amoraim</i> made men walk in the footsteps of the priests. In contrast, following the destruction
                  of the Second Temple, the biblical rituals of the Levites were not adapted for a Judaism
                  without a Temple. Moreover, there is no group comparable to the Levites, namely, no
                  group that is obligated to fewer mitzvot than men and to more mitzvot than women:
                  The in-between category disappears and all that remains are a few rituals that are

                  The rabbinical interpretation of <i>yisrael</i> has been the subject of controversy among researchers. Shaye J.D. Cohen argues that
                  the rabbis have a male understanding of “people” and “Israel” and only those who are
                  obligated to <i>all</i> mitzvot are (entirely) considered “Israel” (Cohen, <i>Why,</i> 120–124); for the differentiation between <i>bnot yisrael</i> and <i>bnei yisrael</i> in Deuteronomy 23:18, see Cohen, <i>Why,</i> 122; for the term <i>am</i> see Rhein, “Toralesung,” 11–13. Tal Ilan’s juxtaposition of Sifre Bamidbar’s and
                  Sifre Devarim’s understanding of biblical commandments reveals different exegetical
                  methods: In Sifre Bamidbar, Ilan identifies an exegesis that for the most part includes
                  women in terms such as <i>ben</i> and <i>bnei yisrael</i>, whereas in Sifre Devarim their exegesis largely excludes women (Ilan, “Daughters
                  of Israel,” 23–28). Using examples from tannaitic literature, Elizabeth Shanks Alexander
                  demonstrates that the rabbinic understanding of <i>bnei yisrael</i> and other terms used for the people differs on a case-by-case basis (Alexander, <i>Gender,</i> 224, footnotes 26 and 27).</p>

                  of the differing obligations of men and women regarding time-bound commandments, women
                  are not merely exempt but rather excluded (נהג, a term that is also used in m. Qiddushin
                  1:8). In m. Qiddushin 1:7, however, the rabbis use the term <i>patur</i>. In the context of <i>tzitzit</i> – rather than with regard to the general principle – Rabbi Shimon also uses the term
                  <i>patur</i> (Sifre Bamidbar on Numbers 15:38; t. Qiddushin 1:10; see Hauptman, “From the Kitchen,”
                  119–122; Labovitz, “A Man Spinning,” 81). In the scholarly literature, women’s exemption
                  from time-bound commandments is often analyzed in light of men’s obligation. Hauptman,
                  in contrast, focuses on the two terms exemption–prohibition: While women were forbidden
                  from performing priestly tasks, the rabbis allowed them voluntarily to perform Temple
                  rituals that were transferred into rabbinic Judaism (Hauptman, <i>Rereading the Rabbis,</i> 227–228; Hauptman, “From the Kitchen,” 119–122).</p>

               <p><a class="fn-back" href="#rfn119">⬑</a>Rashba argues that the prohibition of בל תוסיף (nothing should be added [to the commandments
                  of the Torah]; Deuteronomy 13:1) is not violated by a woman who voluntarily fulfils
                  time-bound commandments because her exemption from these commandments is merely a
                  leniency regarding something to which she is, in principle, obligated (Rashba on b.
                  Eruvin 96a<i>;</i> many thanks to Michel Monheit for pointing out this source to me). Rashba’s statement
                  implies that women – like blind men (b. Bava Qamma 87a) – are obligated to fulfill
                  time-bound commandments because like (sighted) men they are included among the people
                  obligated to fulfill the mitzvot of the Torah (see also Rashi on b. Eruvin 96a–b).
                  When discussing blind men’s obligation or exemption vis-à-vis mitzvot, Rabbi Yehuda
                  argues with an exegesis on Deuteronomy 6:1: “The verse states: ‘And this is the commandment,
                  statutes, and laws’; anyone who is subject to [civil] laws is [also] subject to [the]
                  commandments and statutes, and anyone who is not subject to [civil] laws is [also]
                  not subject to [the] commandments and statutes” (b. Bava Qamma 87a). For the status

                  have been discussing possible reasons for women’s exemption from time-bound commandments
                  (Benovitz, “Time-triggered,” 47–50; Margalit, “Priestly Men,” 301). First and foremost,
                  the arguments focus on women’s household duties and wives’ obligations towards their
                  husbands, both of which might be difficult to reconcile with time-bound mitzvot (Rhein,
                  “Das Gebet,” 315–316; Ross, <i>Expanding the Palace of Torah</i>, 14–19; Hauptman, <i>Rereading the Rabbis,</i> 226; Biale, <i>Women and Jewish Law</i>, 11–14). The fourteenth century scholar David ben Josef Abudarham, for example, took
                  the view that if a woman were obligated to fulfill time-bound mitzvot, she would find
                  herself torn between the obligations towards her husband on the one hand and towards
                  God on the other (Biale, <i>Women and Jewish Law</i>, 13–14). In the 20th century, Saul Berman argued that the rabbis placed women’s duties
                  at home and that obligation to time-bound mitzvot, because their fulfillment tends
                  to take place in a public setting, would conflict with these duties (Berman, “The
                  Status of Women,” 16–17). In addition, it has been suggested – by Samson Raphael Hirsch,
                  for example – that for biological reasons women do not need as many commandments as
                  men (Hirsch, <i>Die fünf Bücher der Torah</i>, 679; Ellinson, <i>Serving</i>, 43–44; Alexander, <i>Gender,</i> 2–3; Benovitz, “Time-triggered,” 58–60). Since the 20th century, the time factor
                  as a reason for women’s exemption from time-bound mitzvot has increasingly been questioned.
                  Judith Hauptman argued in the 1990s that the principle handed down in m. Qiddushin
                  1:7 served the sole purpose of differentiating between men’s and women’s obligations
                  (Hauptman, <i>Rereading the Rabbis,</i> 226–227; see quote below [footnote 127]). Elizabeth Alexander focuses on an exegetical
                  origin of women’s exemption from commandments, which only later developed into a general
                  principle, and Pamela Barmash points out that the rabbis often take a case-by-case
                  approach when discussing women’s obligations and sees a correlation between women’s
                  subordinate role in rabbinic Judaism and their exemption from some commandments (Alexander,
                  <i>Gender,</i> 32–41; see footnote 93; Barmash, “Women and Mitzvot,” 8–13, 31–32); see also Ilan,
                  “Daughters of Israel,” 24–28, Ilan, <i>Jewish Women</i>, 177–179, and Anat Israeli’s outline of the recent history of research (Israeli,

                  that were no longer practiced. Naftali Cohn interprets the exalted role of Temple
                  rituals in rabbinic literature as the Tannaites’ reaction to the importance of the
                  Temple to the people even after its destruction, on the one hand, and as a strategy
                  to further the acceptance and authority of rabbinic Judaism, on the other (Cohn, <i>The Memory</i>, 73–74).</p>

                  Gribetz compares a man’s morning and evening <i>shema</i> (m. Berakhot 1:1) to a woman’s examination of her body morning and evening for signs
                  of menstrual blood (m. Niddah 1:7). Both of these rituals – recitation of the <i>shema</i> and self-examination for the purpose of establishing ritual purity – were performed
                  by priests in the Temple (Gribetz, “Time, Gender, and Ritual,” 143–152; on priestly
                  recitation of the <i>shema</i> see footnote 131 below). Sylvie-Anne Goldberg compares <i>niddah</i>, <i>hallah,</i> and <i>hadlakat haner</i> to priestly tasks (Goldberg, “Is Time,” 22–23; see also Marx, “The Missing Temple,”
                  67). In any case, men as well as women are obligated to <i>hallah</i> and <i>hadlakat haner</i> (Barmash, “Women and Mitzvot,” 5, 15–16); this is why these mitzvot are, <i>de jure</i>, not really “women’s commandments,” even though they are culturally transmitted as

                  different religious practices for men and women) is that they all serve as “ersatz

               <p><a class="fn-back" href="#rfn140">⬑</a>Like the clarification of the role of priests with regard to <i>shofar</i> handed down in tractate Rosh Hashanah, however, the Gemara in tractate Arakhin clarifes
                  the obligation of priests in the context of <i>sukkah</i>: Unlike on-duty priests, off-duty priests (along with ordinary men) are obligated
                  to <i>sukkah</i> (b. Arakhin 3b).</p>

                  Torah, the men and women of Israel were subject, as a rule, to the same commandments,
                  in priestly families it was exclusively the men who were assigned to carry out Temple
                  duties. The hierarchy of mitzvot between men and women within priestly families is
                  thus transformed into a hierarchy of mitzvot between men and women generally.</p>
